      <h2>Exercise</h2>
      <p>Exercise is the foundation of muscle building, and resistance training is the most effective way to build muscle mass. It is recommended to engage in resistance training at least two to three times a week, focusing on compound exercises that target multiple muscle groups. Examples of these exercises include squats, deadlifts, bench press, and rows.</p>
      <p>In addition to resistance training, it is also important to engage in cardiovascular exercise to improve overall fitness and health. This can include activities such as running, cycling, and swimming.</p>

      <h2>Nutrition</h2>
      <p>Nutrition is just as important as exercise when it comes to building muscle. Consuming a diet high in protein and calories is crucial for building muscle mass and providing the body with the energy needed for intense exercise. It is recommended to consume at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, and to increase overall caloric intake by 500-1000 calories per day, depending on individual goals and needs.</p>
      <h3>Foods to Focus On</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Protein-rich foods, such as chicken, fish, eggs, and dairy products</li>
        <li>Complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, sweet potatoes, and whole grain bread</li>
        <li>Healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts, and olive oil</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rest and Recovery</h2>
      <p>Rest and recovery are essential for building muscle, as the body needs time to repair and rebuild muscle tissue after intense exercise. It is recommended to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night, and to allow adequate time for rest and recovery between workouts. This may include taking one or two days off from exercise each week, or engaging in light activities such as yoga or stretching.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, building muscle requires a combination of exercise and nutrition, as well as rest and recovery. By following a consistent workout routine, consuming a balanced diet, and allowing time for rest and recovery, individuals can achieve their muscle building goals. As always, it is important to consult with a doctor or a registered dietitian for personalized recommendations.</p>
