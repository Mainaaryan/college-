      <p>Exercise is a key component of weight gain, as it helps build muscle mass and increase overall strength.

      <h2>Nutrition</h2>

Consuming a diet high in protein and calories is important for building muscle mass, as well as providing the body with the energy needed for intense exercise. It is recommended to consume at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, and to increase overall caloric intake by 500-1000 calories per day, depending on individual goals and needs.</p>
      <h3>Foods to Focus On</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Protein-rich foods, such as chicken, fish, eggs, and dairy products</li>
        <li>Complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, sweet potatoes, and whole grain bread</li>
        <li>Healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts, and olive oil</li>
      </ul>
