    <h1>How to do a weight loss?</h1>

    <p>Achieving healthy weight loss isn’t about a “diet” or “program” but a lifestyle with healthy eating patterns, regular physical activity, and stress management. Medications taken for other conditions may also make it harder to lose weight. If you are concerned about your weight or have questions about your medications, talk with your health care provider.</p>
     <h2>Even modest weight loss can mean big benefits..</h2>

     <p1>Even a modest weight loss of 5% to 10% of your total body weight is likely to produce health benefits,<br> 
      <br> as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars.
      <br> For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, a 5% weight loss is 10 pounds, bringing your weight down to 190 pounds. While this weight may still be in the “overweight” or “obesity” range, this modest weight loss can decrease your risk for chronic diseases related to obesity. 
      <br> So even if the overall goal seems large, see it as a journey rather than a final destination. You’ll learn new eating and physical activity habits that will help you live a healthier lifestyle. These habits can help you maintain your weight loss over time.</p1>
